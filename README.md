# JWT.cr
A Crystal implementation of [JSON Web Token](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519).

This library is not done yet and doesn't work.  It's a fork of https://github.com/jwt/ruby-jwt.

Feel free to help me finish this up.  It's a pretty small library so it shouldn't take long to completely convert.  I am very busy so I can only work on it in small increments here and there.
